## LECTURES

### January 21: Introduction to Population Health

-   Foundations of population health

-   what it is, how it's measured, and what drives it. 

-   Through case studies and group work, you explore determinants, disparities, and interventions from policy to individual care.

### Key Population Health Concepts

-   How to compare health events across populations (by time, place, group, or event) using core epidemiologic measures.

-   Key population health concepts, and data access.

-   Students learn to describe, explain, predict, and control disparities---and apply these tools in a hands-on group exercise.

### Measuring Health and Disease in Population

-   Turning raw counts of disease, births, and deaths into standardized measures so we can compare across time, place, and groups.

-   Calculating disease prevalence, incidence, crude rate, SMR, life tables, life expectancy, Preston curve

-   Population pyramids, demographic transitions

-   How population structure and aging drive health challenges and policies?

### Health Indicators and Indices and Advanced Epidemiological Measures

-   Death certificates, health surveys, hospital records

-   Are data sources reliable?

-   Fusing data sources for better monitoring.

-   DALYs, QALYS

-   Sensitivity, specificity

-   How good are diagnostic tests? Are they predicting well?

### Health Determinants

-   Health is shaped by genetics, environment, lifestyle, and socioeconomic/cultural factors.

-   The biopsychosocial model and life course perspective show how these determinants interact over time.

-   Pathway analysis highlights complex interactions among determinants.

-   Nonlinear dynamics (feedback loops, thresholds) can lead to unexpected health outcomes.

### Health Risk Assessment and Causation

-   Core components of risk assessment: hazard identification, dose--response, exposure, and risk characterization.

-   Life course epidemiology links exposures across the lifespan to health risks.

-   Causation frameworks: Hume, Mill, Koch, Bradford Hill criteria.

-   Risk models use measures of association (e.g., odds ratios) to integrate causation.

### Designing Population Health Studies

-   Study designs (RCT, case-control, cross-sectional, lon gitudinal incl. cohort...)

-   Ethical concerns (vaccine).

-   Validity, reliability, errors, bias and confounding.

### Planning Population Interventions

-   Types and levels of interventions.

-   Criteria for screening.

-   Behavioral models for health promotion.

-   Cross-cultural issues & Case studies.

### Evaluating Health Programs

-   Framework for evaluations and evaluation methods

-   Economic appraisal and case studies

### Infectious diseases

-   Transmission routes, host, vector

-   Compartmental models: SIR

-   Visualizing outbreaks

-   Applied case studies

### Cartography and Population Health

-   Visualizing Health Data on Maps

-   Challenges of Small Numbers and Rare Events

-   Spatial Patterns, Clusters, and Ecological Fallacy

### AI in Population Health

-   Predicting Health Risks

-   AI and Social Determinants of Health

-   Evaluating and Targeting Interventions

-   Ethical Challenges of AI in Pop. Health
